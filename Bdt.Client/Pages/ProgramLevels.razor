    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        In BDP, every second of every workout is geared towards a training goal.
        But where do those goals come from? The answer: the four-tiered Level System that governs the Busy Dad Program.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        As a practitioner of BDP, you will be assigned a specific level within the program on the basis of your current
        degree of fitness in the two Sacred Movements. Your long-term goal is to complete the Busy Dad Program. That’s
        like building the house. Your medium-term goal is to advance to the next level within the program.
        That’s like building a room in the house. And your immediate term goal is to do something that helps you edge
        closer to the next training level. That’s like laying a brick in the foundation.

    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Every level of the system is unlocked by two Landmark Workouts: one 20-minute 6-count workout, and one 20-minute
        Navy Seal Workout. Let’s break down those levels and the Landmark Workouts that unlock them.

    <MudText Class="mt-5" Align="MudBlazor.Align.Center" Typo="Typo.h6">LEVEL 1</MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 1 is the most elementary level of the program, and it is further differentiated into four sublevels.
        There is an enormous difference between someone at the beginning of Level 1 and someone at the end of Level 1,
        and the sub-levels are in place to acknowledge those differences.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 1A is the most elementary level of BDP. To unlock 1A, you simply need to be able to perform one 6-count
        in 20 minutes and one Navy Seal in 20 minutes. If you can do that, welcome to the Busy Dad Program! You’re a 1A practitioner!
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 1B is unlocked by the following two Landmark Workouts: 50 6-counts in 20 minutes; 20 Navy Seals in 20 minutes.
        Once you complete these workouts, you’ve made your first level-change within the program! Congratultions!
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 1C is unlocked by the following two Landmark Workouts: 100 6-counts in 20 minutes; 40 Navy Seals in 20 minutes.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Finally, Level 1D is unlocked by the following Landmark Workouts: 150 6-counts in 20 minutes; 60 Navy Seals in 20 minutes.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Once you unlock Level 1D, your new training mission is to unlock Level 2.
    </MudText>

    <MudDivider DividerType="DividerType.Middle" Class="my-6" />

    <MudText Class="mt-5" Align="MudBlazor.Align.Center" Typo="Typo.h6">LEVEL 2</MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 2 is unlocked by the following two Landmark Workouts: 200 6-counts in 20 minutes; 80 Navy Seals in 20 minutes. This one is a big deal.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        From here, we start pushing toward Level 3.
    </MudText>

    <MudText Class="mt-5" Align="MudBlazor.Align.Center" Typo="Typo.h6">LEVEL 3</MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        The Landmark Workouts that unlock Level 3 are 250 6-counts in 20 minutes and 100 Navy Seals in 20 minutes. These numbers are respectable by any standard at all.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        But we keep pushing. 80 minutes per week, week in, week out. And we’re building towards Level 4.
    </MudText>
    
    <MudDivider DividerType="DividerType.Middle" Class="my-6" />

    <MudText Class="mt-5" Align="MudBlazor.Align.Center" Typo="Typo.h6">LEVEL 4</MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        Level 4 is unlocked by the following two Landmark Workouts: 275 6-counts in 20 minutes; 120 Navy Seals in 20 minutes.
        It was a steep climb from Level 3 to Level 4. But it was one of the most satisfying feelings in my journey with BDP the day I unlocked Level 4.

        Where to next?

    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        BDP is a bounded program. It has an end. And once you’re a Level 4 practitioner, the end is in sight. Well, sort of. The jump from Level 4 to
        Graduation might actually be the biggest single jump within the entirety of the program. Martial arts shouldn’t give out their black belts willy-nilly,
        and graduating BDP shouldn’t be a straightforward matter, either.
    </MudText>
    <br />
    <MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
        To graduate the Busy Dad Program, you must perform the following two Graduation Workouts, both within the same week: 325 6-counts in 20 minutes;
        150 Navy Seals in 20 minutes.  Note also that you must call out every count of both movements.
